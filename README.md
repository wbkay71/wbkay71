# 👋 Hi, I'm Wanja

I'm currently enrolled in the **AI Engineer Track at Masterschool** (Term 4),  
where I'm learning and building with **Python**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **SQL**.

I'm especially interested in the intersection of **AI, creativity, and storytelling** –  
how we can use technology to **create meaning**, not just efficiency.

💼 By trade, I'm a **Creative Executive Producer** and founder of [WBK Media GmbH](https://www.wbkmedia.de),  
developing media formats, documentaries, and educational content – now enhanced by AI.
